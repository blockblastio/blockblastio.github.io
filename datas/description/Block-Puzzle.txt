Use Corners: Try to place larger, awkward-shaped blocks in the corners of the grid. This will free up space in the center, where smaller blocks are easier to fit.
Save Space: Avoid leaving small gaps on the grid, as they can be difficult to fill later on. Always aim to leave as much open space as possible.
Don't Rush: Since there is no time limit, take your time and consider all your options before placing a block.
Focus on Clearing Lines: Always prioritize moves that clear rows or columns, as this will give you more space to work with and boost your score.
